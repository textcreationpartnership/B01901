            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>JOHN Mallett</hi> (Thirteenth of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) having a Deſign to Cut this New Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſued out an <hi>Ad quod Damnum,</hi> and had a Commiſſion under the Great Seal, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with the Owners of the Lands, through which he was to Cut; and was alſo fain to Cleanſe, and Scour the Old River, and make an entire new Cut, for the ſpace of near half a Mile, and to Erect thereupon ſeveral Sluces, and Floodgates, and to make one Bridge over it, and to keep the ſame in Repair ever ſince, for the Benefit of Paſſengers that way; (it being an High-way for all People to travel in.) All which he did at his own Charge, without any Contribution from any Body, and therein Expended Six thouſand Pounds and upwards.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid <hi>John Mallett,</hi> after he had perfected the ſaid Work, to the great advantage of the Country thereabouts, dying before he reaped any Benefit thereby: And his Heirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very young, and the ill Times coming on, there was no Care taken of his, and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Pattent, for ſettling the Navigation of the ſaid new Cut River, till the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, tho' they did before receive Rent for it.</p>
            <p>And then, upon Certificate of the Judges of Aſſize, and the Gentlemen of the Country, a Pattent was Granted to the ſaid Ladies, and they have Farmed the ſaid Navigation to Tenants for an Annual Rent.</p>
            <p>But by reaſon of their Tenants, demanding unreaſonable Rates of Paſſengers through the ſaid new Cut, ſeveral Diſputes, and Suits in Law, did ariſe thereupon; To end thoſe Diſputes, and quiet all Differences for the future, this Bill is deſired, that a reaſonable Toll may be ſet upon every Boat, and Lighter, that ſhall paſs under the ſaid Bridge, or Load, or unload Goods, within the ſaid Cut, (the ſaid Ladies and their Heirs, being obliged by the Commſſioners of Sewers, to Repair the ſaid Bridge, and Cleanſe the ſaid Cut.)</p>
            <p>And it being very Beneficial to the Country, to have this Water-paſſage open, for the Carriage of their Goods, and Merchandize; and to have the ſaid Bridge kept in good Repair, this Bill will ſettle the whole Matter.</p>
